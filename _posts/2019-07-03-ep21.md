Y’all Boys’ 10-year High School reunion is one week away and while the pressure is at a fever pitch, that doesn’t stop them from doing impressions of each other and warning you to NEVER TAKE A CASH ADVANCE. This week Frank realizes good mental health sometimes involves unfollowing a playlist, Max skirts around completing his final goals, Steve stop waiting all together and when Josh has some bad news for #TeamJosh, members of #TeamJosh make their frustrations very well known.

The #STTT of the Week goes to Taraji P. Henson who is the co-founder of the Boris Lawrence Henson Foundation which is committed to changing the perception of mental illness in the African-American community by encouraging those who suffer with this debilitating illness to get the help they need.
