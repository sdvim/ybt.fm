After enjoying the sun and sliding downstairs in a box, they’re back! With a new saga comes new challenges and Y’all Boys are not holding back. They discuss what they’ve done on their time off, the old challenges they kept (or didn’t keep) and what it truly means to be ‘hood adjacent’. On top of all that, Steve has a major announcement that will change the landscape of this saga, and Y’all Boys, forever...

The #STTT of the Week goes to Boyan Slat who is a Dutch 25-year-old who founded “The Ocean Cleanup” which develops technology to extract plastic pollution from the oceans.
