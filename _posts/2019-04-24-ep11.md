If you didn’t think that this podcast was low-key about toppling the patriarchy one podcast at a time, you are surely mistaken as Josh gives the most passionate rebuttal to haters ever recorded on a podcast this week. Along with that, Y’all Boys discuss the impending streaming juggernaut Disney+, shaky GoFundMes, “L” the cat going on a rampage, dope Hot Springs and stepping it up on downward escalators.

The #STTT of the Week is Dr. Katie Bouman, a MIT scientist who helped form the algorithm that made the impossible dream of capturing an image of a black hole possible by sticking with her goals and keeping the haters out of her feed.
