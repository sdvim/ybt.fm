In a YBT first, two Boys are out due to scheduling conflicts and so New York City natives Frank and Max take the reins. Max aims at a calendar and misses, Frank does not get a proxy child and in their challenge checkups, Steve braves the Utah cold while Josh starts his standup career.

The #STTT of the Week goes to Havard vs Yale Football Game Climate Protestors who protested in response to the schools being heavily invested in many fossil fuel companies despite having students who overwhelmingly oppose climate change.
