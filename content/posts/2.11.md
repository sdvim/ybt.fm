There’s been hard weeks on Y’all Boys Talkin’ but this one was a haaaard week y’all listeners. Max is back but the flu is still there and by the end of this episode you might be thinking _“Do they all have the flu? They trippin’ right now...”_ Josh, now officially 30 years old takes on a more mature tone but loses some points when his birthday celebration goes on for too long, Steve has a major breakthrough with one of the seniors, Max takes his time rehabbing and Frank receives a not-so-great call from his father that straps a rocket to his back.

The #STTT of the Week goes to Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez who, along with their company Tiller and Hatch donated a years worth of food to Jacksboro Elementary School to fill the schools pantry after they saw a post from a teacher at the school where she told the story of one of her kids who was dealing with not having food in their home.
