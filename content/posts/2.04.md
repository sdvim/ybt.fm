What’s an American wedding celebration without a Bachelor Party amirite?! Y’all Boys take a trip to scenic...Homestead, Florida to record another live, in-person podcast at the end of “Steve’s Final Smash”. Steve digs into his new bike fighting game, Frank warns about doing things for clout, Josh learns how to commission a traffic study and Max’s long relationship with American Football is tested.

The #STTT of the Week goes to the State of California which pushed forward bills like AB5, which helps independent contractors earn employee status, votes to ban private prisons and passes a law for college athletes to be paid for their likenesses, all in the same week.
