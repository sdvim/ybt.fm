Kendrick Lamar frequently asks: “Are you on ten yet?” This episode lives on ten in all the ways that are possible for it to live on ten. Y’all Boys discuss the boundaries of the n-word, Max is broadcasting live (on tape) from Paris, France, Josh takes a deep dive into his finances, Frank admits to wearing Shaquille O’ Neal branded clothing and Steve lives up to the Straight to the Top lifestyle by finding a way to be a hero in real life! 

Speaking of real-life heroes, the #STTT of the Week is Akbar Cook (**@principal_akbar**), who goes above and beyond the call of duty of a High School Principal and tries to make some tough lives a little easier.
