The wedding looms ahead and the fantasy football of accountability returns by both talking about generational debt as well as what they would do with invulnerability. This week Steve makes sure that all of his bike spokes are authentic, Frank understands the importance of Soy Sauce, Max explains how to translate piano notes to violin notes and Josh has himself a good ol’ fashioned, no nonsense, work with his hands, salt of the earth existential crisis!

The #STTT of the Week goes to Robert F. Smith who is a billionaire and venture capitalist who pledged to, not only pay off the student loan debts of the Morehouse College class of 2019, but the debts of their parents as well, clearing out some generational debt that may have plagued to graduates in the future.
