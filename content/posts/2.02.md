Steve’s off in Utah and the rest of Y’all Boys are here U..talkin (I apologize for that) about their first week of doing the challenges! Long story short, it isn’t pretty. Frank’s kitchen doesn’t get a lot of play, Max has a run in with a webinar and Josh figures out what to do with the rest of his ‘party favors’.

The #STTT of the Week goes to eight year old Christian Moore whose small act of kindness to his classmate made a huge impact.
