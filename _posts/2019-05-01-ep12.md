Steve is out on bae-cation in Arizona so that leaves Josh, Frank and Max to question what their 19-year old selves would think of them now, ponder how hard we should think about company slogans, bow down to Queen Bey and dispel conspiracy theories about themselves.

The #STTT of the Week is Amanda Nguyen, activist and founder of Rise Justice Labs: a start up incubator for civil rights movements, who dedicated her life to not only be #STTT but help others get #STTT.
