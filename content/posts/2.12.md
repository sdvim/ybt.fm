Thanksgiving is coming up soon and the Y’all Boys are both thankful to have each other and Y’all listeners as well. We hope your Wednesdays are lovely, especially this week where Frank, along with the rallying #TeamFrank, elaborates on learned helplessness, Steve continues making connections with the elderly, Josh gets a huge phone call that bring major momentum to #TeamJosh and Max takes his sick ass on a pilgrimage.

The #STTT of the Week goes to the Paradise Bobcats Football Team who o.ne year after a horrific fire, the Paradise High School Football Team gave the small California town hope by completing an undefeated season of 9-0.
