With Steve off on bae-cation, the rest of Y’all Boys take over the reigns to discuss their rocky first week of challenges, mathematically justifying Hungry-Man TV Dinners, the dangers of large credit card limits and the first recorded vocabulary-related injury. Plus, this week’s #STTT of the Week shows us an incredible step forward in science that may or may not have been enhanced if it was streamed on Twitch.
