Avoidance behavior is in full effect this week as Y’all Boys get real on the winding road to The Top. On their journey we’ll learn about using Settlers of Catan as a scapegoat, mathing your way out of situations and editing a podcast without headphones.

Also the #STTT of the Week went from a first generation child of immigrants to becoming one of the heads of a major video game company! His body, truly, was ready…(this is less sexual than you think…)

Mentioned this week: Financial Advice for Millenials [(pdf)](https://www.etf.com/docs/IfYouCan.pdf)
