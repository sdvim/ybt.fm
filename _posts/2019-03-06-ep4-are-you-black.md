Y’all Boys have a lot on their plates this week as they discuss the ramifications of the new Michael Jackson documentary, the fluidity of racial identity, a $50 Therapy gift card and THE COMPLETE AND UTTER BULLS*** that is Los Angeles traffic. This week’s #STTT of the Week are two people from The Bronx who kept their integrity and on the other hand, Y’all Boys reward their first ever #STTB to someone who did not plan things out too well.
