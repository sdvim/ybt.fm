Straight up, this podcast is three more conversations away from being a full on Spider-Man podcast. Spider-Verse is sooooo good, go see it if you haven’t! Anyway, this week Y’all Boys take a deep dive into interracial relationships, Garageband preset names and the true meaning of “fun”. The #STTT of the Week goes to a young person who is looking at the iceberg (or lack thereof) and not only calling that ish out, but started a movement along with it!
