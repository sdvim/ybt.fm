Yo, there are so many “L”s on this episode that Cool J had to give up a few due to demand. Bitter colds, cats with no regards for sheets, the trauma of spilling food, and the use of black people to sell video games are all addressed on this jam-packed episode! The #STTT of the Week is so groundbreaking, that Y’all Boys are straight up unable to even. You definitely gotta get in on this verifiable shindig!

See [“The Self-Contained Hootenanny”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zh-lKF6UuLk) in action!
