The three pillars of YBT are Brotherhood, Mental Health and $120,000 Bananas. The boys say goodbye to JuiceWRLD, Steve's got some challenges and he's also got some "challenges", Frank covers himself in the warm blanket of self-pity, Max preps himself for interrogations and Josh makes a huge formal announcement about his future in Miami.

The #STTT of the Week goes to Kansas City, Missouri where lawmakers unanimously voted to make public transportation in the city free of charge, setting the stage for it to be the first major U.S. city to have free public transit.
