Time keeps on slippin, slippin, slippin, into the future and the 10 year reunion looms closer than ever so Y’all Boys need to get to steppin! On that road they discuss the future of Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson movies, the rebounds that Josh makes for #TeamJosh, Frank playing no games, Steve slips up and Max goes back in time to fail.

The #STTT of the Week goes to Valerie Castile who three years after the shooting death of her son Philando Castile, Valerie has given $8,000 to a Minnesota high school to settle school lunch debts that could have kept them from graduating, continuing the philanthropic work of her son.
