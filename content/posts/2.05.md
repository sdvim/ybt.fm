Holy sh*t. This got dark quick. Josh’s creative process goes under intense scrutiny, Max takes orders from a 17 year old, that boi Steve forgets to hang out with his bed and Frank’s stress leads him to some tough memories.

The #STTT of the Week goes to The Youths who were led by the amazing human being Greta Thunberg to march worldwide for climate action to get their voices heard about their concern for the future.
