After much anticipation and build up, Steve has completed his wedding and returns to the land of accountability to take his seat back in the House of Y’all...he still gotta do his sh*t doe. This week Frank celebrates making trash, Max levels up in his climbing skills, Josh competes in a short story competition and Steve has a rough landing in his return to the land of accountability.

The #STTT of the Week goes to a Keanon Lowe who is an Oregon football coach who became a hero when he disarmed a student with a shotgun and embraced him until the police arrived.
