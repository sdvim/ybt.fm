This podcast was built on the frame of friends keeping each other accountable and BOY does that really come into action this week, so get out your Christmas Tree, set up your Festivus pole and give thanks to your Kwanzaa Bush (Is that a thing? I don’t think that’s a thing…). Steve thinks about thinking about it, Max reflects on his low grades, Josh continues his journey with party favors and Frank gets into an hour long fight with egg whites.

The #STTT of the Week goes to Elias Da Hora Jr. is a pastor, father, husband, brother, son bro and newly minted United States citizen. #SaveDACA
