At the end of the first Guardians of The Galaxy film, all the Guardians hold hands and find that the power of community and a family is all they needed to get through... this is not like that because Y’all Boys are too far away from each other and it's fairly common knowledge that Star Lord never ordered UberEats. Steve reports live (on tape) from Nicaragua, Max makes major progress on his novel, Frank deals with a “spicy” situation at work and Josh tests the limits of #TeamJosh after a particularly rough week.

The #STTT of the Week goes to Nicky Case a designer who explains systems of the world around us including social, physical, political, ecominic, and environmental systems and through the power of games.
