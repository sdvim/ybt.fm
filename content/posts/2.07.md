Before we get into this, quick s/o to Kix. I’m not sure what they were going for but they really cornered the market on...that flavor. This week, with Steve out doing wedding duties, Max finds out the hardest thing to climb is his own self doubt, Frank messes up a recipe by adding all of the salt and Josh gets inspired and finally put pen to paper on his one man show!

The #STTT of the Week goes to Simone Biles for being so great that they literally changed all the rules around her.
