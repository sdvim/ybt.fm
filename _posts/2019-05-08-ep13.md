Y’all Boys are equally *for* accountability and hard work as they are *against* the convenience of Uber Eats. This week features a drastic change to the 10 year reunion transportation plans, a long streak being broken, a singer with a hella racist past, booing people into good habits and Max has a major announcement that rocks this podcast to the core.

The #STTT of the Week goes to the Eureka Ensemble’s Women’s Chorus which is a program that connects women ages 19 to 82 who are experiencing poverty and homelessness with the healing power of music and community.
